Example JSON:
```json
{
    "mode": "PAGEVIEW",
    "startUrls": ["https://apify.com/"],
    "enableCrawling": true,
    "enableYoutube": false,
    "duplicateActor": 2,
    "waitForPageview": true
}
```


### Input Parameters Explained
- `enableCrawling`: (Optional)

	If the webpage you want to increase traffic to, has multiple links and subpages, the actor will also work and increase traffic to these pages.
- `enableYoutube`: (Optional) (Experimental Feature)

    This feature is for YouTube videos. For more information, check ‚ÄúExample Input Scenario‚Äù after this section. üëá
- `waitOnPage`: (Optional) (Only on Pageview Mode)

	How much time that the actor stay on each of the pages. If you want to specify the number of seconds that the actor will spend on every page, you should enable and fill this field.
- `endAfterSeconds`: (Optional)

    You can limit the time of working of the actor. Basically, if you want to kill the actor after a certain number of seconds, you should enable and fill this field.

    The actor runs forever unless you abort it. That's why you should always set the option of endAfterSeconds. If you want to generate traffic constantly then keep this option as empty.
- `duplicateActor`: (Optional)

	This option will duplicate the current run with this number. Please keep in mind that the load on the website will be multiplied by this number.

    Remember great power comes with great responsibility. If you want to double the actor number, make sure to do it under control. If you fill this field by 3, then the actor will clone itself and run by 4 runs in total. However, you should always keep in mind that there is a limitation that you have on Apify (memory or CUs) which you can find on your dashboard.

    This option is created for stress-load tests.
- `proxy`: (Required) (Proxy Object)
    Proxy configuration.

This solution requires the use of Proxy servers, either your proxy servers or you can use [Apify Proxy](https://www.apify.com/docs/proxy).


### Example Input Scenario 1: How to Generate YouTube Video View?
For instance, if you want the actor to stay for 2 minutes in your Youtube video; set the ‚Äúwait on page‚Äù value to 120 seconds, and set the ‚Äúend after‚Äù value as 1200 seconds to produce 10 views. After 1200 seconds, the actor will stop working.

(Don‚Äôt forget to switch to Youtube Pageview test on)

## Output
Check the analytics of your website while the actor runs, you will see the results in minutes!


### Important Note
The Traffic Generator Actor is a powerful tool designed to significantly elevate traffic across various platforms, **but please note it doesn‚Äôt store its operational data in a dataset. Monitor the Traffic Generator's effectiveness directly through your analytics dashboard.**

Please keep in mind that actor duplication is a very strong option to generate traffic to the website. Ex: If you fill this field by 3, then the actor will clone itself and run by 4 runs in total. However, you should always keep in mind that there is a limitation that you have on Apify (memory or CUs) which you can find on your dashboard.

The actor runs forever unless you abort it. That's why you should always set the option of `endAfterSeconds`. If you want to generate traffic constantly then keep this option as empty.


## During the Run
During the run, the actor will output messages letting you know what is going on. Each message always contains a short label specifying which page from the provided list is currently specified.

If you provide incorrect input to the actor, it will immediately stop with a failure state and output an explanation of what is wrong.


### Compute Unit Consumption
The actor is optimized to run blazing fast and scrape as many listings as possible. Therefore, it forefronts all requests. If the actor doesn't block very often it'll scrape 100 pages in 2 minutes with ~0.03-0.05 compute units.
